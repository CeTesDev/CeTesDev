## My Summary
I am a Master of Mathematics and Bachelor of Computer Science.\
I have been working as a software engineer since 2014, the period during which I have worked in different environments, from big consultancy companies to start-ups. I am a self-motivated and self-taught professional who likes to solve problems. 
I merge a passion for usability and user experience with technical knowledge to create cool digital experiences. My repertoire includes BlockChain, 3D computer graphics, computer vision and more.


### **Please check out my [Portfolio](https://cetes.dev/summary/) for more information about what I do!**

Thanks for viewing my profile!\
I am a programmer and researcher.

I was a Computer Graphics and Comuter Vision developer before, and recently for 3 years I widely create Smart Contracts with [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) and [Assembly](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html) languages.

As a solidity and smart contract developer, my main focus are **Gas Optimization** and **Security**, and **Fastest Algorithm**.
